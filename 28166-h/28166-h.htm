<h2><small>INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS<br />

CUSTOM MARK III<br />

CP SERIES OIL FIRED UNIT</small></h2>


<p><span class="u">GENERAL</span></p>

<p>The Custom Mark III CP Series Oil Fired Unit is a high quality heating
unit that will provide many years of comfortable and economical heat if
properly installed and given proper care. It is <span class="u">IMPORTANT</span> therefore that
these instructions should be followed carefully.</p>


<p><span class="u">SHIPMENT</span></p>

<p>The unit is completely assembled at the factory except for the following
parts which are packed in a separate carton and strapped to the skids
inside the shipping carton:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 - 3/4" × Close Steel Nipple</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" × 3/4" × 1/2" Tee</li>
<li>1 - Fig. 105 Tridicator</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" No. 10-402-05 ASME Relief Valve</li>
<li>1 - 3/4" No. 600-19 Boiler Drain</li>
<li>1 - T87F-2055 Thermostat</li>
</ul>


<p>The jacket extension for 128CPO is shipped in separate carton.</p>


<p><span class="u">DAMAGE IN TRANSIT</span></p>

<p>Upon receipt of shipment of this material, inspect all cartons for
external damage. If external damage is noted, open the carton and
inspect for damage to equipment. Mark the number of cartons received in
this condition on the delivering carrier's waybill, and request the
services of their inspector.</p>

<p>If, upon opening a carton, concealed damage is discovered, open the
entire shipment and note all equipment so damaged. Contact the
delivering carrier and request inspection of the damaged equipment. Do
not destroy the carton. The inspector from the freight company will need
this to determine reason for damage.</p>

<p>Normally claims for any and all damages should be filed with the freight
company within five working days after receipt of shipment.</p>

<p>All materials are sold F.O.B. Factory. It is the responsibility of the
consignee to file claim with the delivering carrier for material
received in a damaged condition.</p>


<p><span class="u">LOCATING UNIT</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;"><span class="u">BEFORE REMOVING SHIPPING CARTON, LOCATE UNIT IN ITS FINAL POSITION</span></span></p>

<p>The carton is plainly marked so as to indicate which is the outlet
burner end of the unit which is also the end where the return and flue
are located. Clearance should be provided in both the front and rear of
the unit for cleaning. Where possible it is good practice to locate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>unit so its sides are parallel to the chimney flue. In all instances
locate unit as near chimney flue as possible in order to avoid use of a
long flue pipe.</p>


<p><span class="u">REMOVING CARTON</span></p>

<p>Once the packaged unit is in its proper place, cut all around the carton
on the scored line as shown on carton. The entire carton may then be
lifted from the skids.</p>

<p>If it is found necessary to move the unit a little more to place it in
the exact location ready for piping, do so before removing skids.</p>

<p>DO NOT PUSH AGAINST ANY PART OF JACKET OR OIL BURNER WHEN MOVING UNIT.
TO MOVE UNIT, PUSH AGAINST <span class="u">SKIDS, FLUE BOX OR SMOKE BOX</span>. PUSHING AGAINST
JACKET WILL RESULT IN DAMAGE.</p>


<p><span class="u">REMOVING SKIDS</span></p>

<p>The skids are specially designed for easy removal. It is necessary,
however, to follow these instructions carefully.</p>

<ol class="AU"><li>After unit is in proper place, remove the two cross
pieces from skids by pulling out all scaffolding (double
headed) nails.</li>

<li>By inserting pinch bar or 2" × 4" underneath the smoke
box (rear of unit), tilt one side of unit just high enough
to lift lugs out of holes in skid, then knock skid out from
underneath unit. Then do the same thing on the other side
of unit. <span class="u">THE UNIT IS NOT BOLTED TO THE SKIDS.</span> The 3/4" lugs
welded to the unit simply fit into the 3/4" holes in the
skids.</li></ol>


<p class="center bbox">
IMPORTANT<br />
<br />
DO NOT TILT UNIT BY PUSHING AGAINST JACKET<br />
<br />
IT IS NOT NECESSARY<br />
<br />
AND BY DOING SO THE JACKET WILL BE DAMAGED<br />
</p>


<p><span class="u">LEVELING UNIT</span></p>

<p>In case floor is uneven, unit may easily be made level by inserting
shims under the 4 shipping lugs. These lugs also keep the jacket 1/2"
off the floor, protecting it from wet floors and dampness.</p>


<p><span class="u">PIPING AND WIRING</span></p>

<p>Once the unit is in its proper location with the packing carton, skids
and packing material removed, it is ready for piping and connection from
Room Thermostat and 110 V. 60 Cy. A.C. Current.</p>


<p><span class="u">CONTROL SYSTEM</span></p>

<p>The controls furnished are for a one zone Forced Water System consisting
of T87F Room Thermostat, L8124A-1007 Triple Acting Aquastat and
Circulator Relay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> C554A-1018 Cadmium Photocell, R8184G-1005 Burner
Relay and V4046A-1009 Oil Valve. Description and complete wiring diagram
will be found packed with each control.</p>


<p><span class="u">SPECIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS</span></p>

<p>For special control systems such as multiple installations, zone
controlled, unit heater, radiant panel, etc., write to factory for
wiring diagrams.</p>


<p><span class="u">CHIMNEY AND BREECHING REQUIREMENTS</span></p>

<p>The CP boiler should be connected to a vertical vent system that will
prevent: (1) positive pressure in the flue, (2) backward flow of flue
gas through the unit when the burner stops, and (3) condensation in the
flue.</p>

<p>Use double-walled or insulated pipe for sections of the flue in cold
areas. All outside vents, except for short extensions, must be insulated
to avoid condensation in the flue. Several types of prefabricated
chimneys are available providing double-walled or insulated pipe, some
with ceramic and others with metallic liners.</p>

<p>While the unit is equipped with an induced draft fan, proper size vent
must be provided to remove the gases of combustion. It is recommended
that a 4" to 5" increaser be used for venting the 87CPO and 108CPO and a
4" to 6" increaser be used for the 128CPO. For abnormal runs (exceeding
10 ft.), consult factory.</p>

<p>Vent and breeching must be gas tight by sealing with asbestos or
thermo-setting pressure sensitive tape.</p>


<p><span class="u">DRAFT REGULATOR</span></p>

<p>It is recommended that a draft regulator be installed in chimney flue
<span class="u">just below the flue pipe opening</span>, if the unit is attached to an
extremely high chimney; an unlined chimney; or a chimney which is
constructed on the exterior of the house.</p>


<p><span class="u">CONTROLS AND TRIM</span></p>

<p>Controls are installed in place at the Factory. Attach thermo-altimeter
in 1/2" tapping in top front of boiler. Install 3/4" × close nipple in
3/4" top connection with 3/4" × 3/4" × 1/2" Tee. 3/4" Tee opening for
installation of the relief valve and 1/2" opening for expansion tank.</p>


<p><span class="u">WIRING</span></p>

<p>Controls are all in place and wired at the factory except connection to
circulator.</p>


<p><span class="u">REGULATING OIL PRESSURE</span></p>

<p>Standard nozzles furnished with the burner will produce the stamped
rated capacity when used with Commercial Standard No. 2 Fuel Oil, and
operated with a pressure of 100 lbs. per square inch. The standard
setting of the fuel unit is 100 lbs. Due to difference in tank
elevations, the pressure should be adjusted at the time of start up.</p>


<p><span class="u">FUEL LINES</span></p>

<p>Care should be employed when attaching the oil lines to the fuel unit.
Overtightening or twisting will twist the pump-motor mounting plate and
put a stress on the motor bearings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="u">START UP PROCEDURE</span></p>

<p>General:</p>

<ol><li>Make certain that correct voltage has been supplied to
motor and control circuit.</li>

<li>Insure that outside air openings are provided in the
boiler room for ventilation, and for admission of air for
combustion. The free area of such openings should not be
less than 7 square inch opening per 100,000 Btuh burner
input, or more as required by local codes.</li>

<li>Check to see that flue, wiring and water level are in
order.</li>

<li>Start burner fan motor to prime pump. If pump does not
pick up oil within a few minutes, prime the pump with
lubricating oil. Do not allow pump to run more than a few
minutes without additional lubrication.</li>

<li>Check oil pressure and adjust if necessary. (See
REGULATING OIL PRESSURE).</li>

<li>Set air shutters. (See ADJUSTING BURNER) Refer to Figure
1.</li>

<li>Generously lubricate the front motor bearing with SAE #20
oil.</li></ol>


<p><span class="u">ADJUSTING BURNER</span> (See Figure 1)</p>

<p>Positioning of the nozzle in relation to the face of the cone and the
electrodes in relation to the nozzle are very important, also the face
of the cone in relation to the face of the choke ring must be set
according to the chart for each rate.</p>

<p>If the air shutter openings are too large the oil may not ignite.</p>

<ol><li>This setting will vary somewhat depending upon the grade
of oil being used or if No. 1 is used instead of No. 2.</li>

<li>The approximate burner air setting may be determined by
observing the fire through the observation port on the front
of the boiler. If the flame is smoky, the air shutter should
be opened until the fire burns clean, without any trace of
smoke. The flame should be bright yellow in color with the
tips of the flame turning orange. If the flame is too white,
reduce the amount of air admitted; and, if too red or smoky
increase the air.</li>

<li>Final adjustments should be made using a flue gas
analyzer to measure the CO<sub>2</sub> content of the flue gas and a
Bacharach model smoke meter or equivalent to determine the
amount of smoke (not to exceed a "TRACE").</li>

<li class="lsoff">For checking efficiency only the stack temperature and CO<sub>2</sub>
may be taken immediately after the fan and refer to the
standard efficiency charts for the results. Readings of 5 to
8% taken after the fan correspond to 10 to 12% taken in the
rear uptake of the boiler.</li>

<li class="lsoff">The reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> reading in the flue is caused by the
air being drawn in around the motor shaft for cooling
purposes. The motor cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> air is at ambient temperature
and, therefore, does not add energy to or subtract energy
from the flue gas analysis, it only adds volume to the flue
gas. Therefore, applying this data to standard efficiency
charts will give a true indication of flue gas loss.</li></ol>

<p class="center bbox">
NOTE<br />
<br />
Final adjustment should be made after
the burner has been firing continuously
for at least 10 minutes, as the fan pulls
less air when the flue gases are hot.<br />
</p>


<p>A. CHECK LIMIT CONTROL</p>

<ul><li>Run the burner long enough to bring the water temperature up to at least
190 degrees then turn the limit control setting until the burner stops.</li></ul>

<p class="center bbox">
NOTE<br />
<br />
The Minimum limit setting for any hot water
boiler should be 140 degrees F. in order to
prevent corrosion of the flues on the fire
side. The burner should be run with the primary
control thermostat terminals jumpered and the
burner controlled directly from an aquastat
keeping the boiler hot all the time, thus
eliminating the sweating of the flues on the
fire side caused by starting from a cold start.<br />
</p>


<p><span class="u">BELT ADJUSTMENT</span></p>

<p>The proper tension on the fuel unit belt drive is set at the factory.
However, the belt should be checked periodically to see that the setting
is maintained. To check setting, first, remove the belt guard and then,
using fingers, compress the belt at a point midway between the sheaves.
The proper setting at this point measured between the outer edges of the
belt, should be between 1-3/4" and 1-7/8". If adjustment is necessary
loosen the two mounting bolts, and move the fuel unit up or down to give
the necessary belt setting. Then re-tighten the mounting bolts securely
and replace the belt guard.</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
